gaitutils TODO



               
fix automark:
    -mark fp strikes directly (if available)
    -adapt code to use strike_toeoff_velocity()

-(consistency) plot ylimits needs fixing

-exceptions policy

-layouts should go into config or separate layouts file

-unnormalized model plotting ok?

-validate (against gaitplotter & Nexus)

-small discrepancies in c3d/Nexus cycles?
    -nexus returns smaller frame indices (sometimes)

-pip install? (eventually)








Nexus / c3d fplate API:

-forceplate z axis is down (positive force towards ground)
-coord system is right-handed

-c3d plate boundaries may be wrong? (assume AMTI plate dimensions)
    -NVUG2017 example data ok but check others vs. Nexus
http://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io/docs/API/classbtk_1_1_a_m_t_i_force_platform_file_i_o.html

-create transformation matrix + translation vector from plate boundaries
https://www.c3d.org/HTML/default.htm?turl=corners.htm

Nexus rot matrix gives wrong plate corners, but CoP is correct (matches Nexus output)?

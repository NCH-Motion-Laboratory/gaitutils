gaitutils TODO:

-missing variables? e.g. trying to plot missing EMG ch causes error in
_var_type - script cannot know whether it's EMG or not

-config gets imported at too many places

-validate (gaitplotter, Nexus)

-cop calculation causes runtime warning (div by zero)

-unnormalized model plotting not yet working fully

-small discrepancies in c3d/Nexus cycles?
    -nexus returns smaller frame indices (sometimes)

-packaging

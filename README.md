# gaitutils

Gaitutils facilitates extracting and plotting gait data. It also includes some data processing functionality (e.g. automatic event detection). Mainly for purposes of the Helsinki Movement Analysis Laboratory, but should be adaptable to other labs with a little bit of work. 

Gaitutils can work with Vicon Nexus and also read directly from .c3d files (if you install the btk package).

Python 2.7 (Anaconda recommended).

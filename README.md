# gaitutils

The aim of gaitutils is to provide convenient methods for extracting and plotting 3D gait analysis data. Compared to packages such as btk, it provides higher-level interface, with abstractions such as 'trial' and 'gait cycle'. Data can be read from Vicon Nexus or directly from c3d files.

An example operation would be "read a trial from Vicon Nexus, extract all gait cycles with valid forceplate contact, normalize the kinetics data to those cycles, and plot the ankle dorsi/plantarflexion moment". This can be accomplished with just a couple of lines of code. The package also includes a PyQt5-based GUI for plotting and processing operations.

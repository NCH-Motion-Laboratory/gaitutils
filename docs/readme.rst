gaitutils
=========

The aim of gaitutils is to provide convenient methods for extracting, processing and
plotting of 3D gait analysis data. Compared to packages such as btk, it
provides higher-level interface, with abstractions such as 'trial' and
'gait cycle'. Data can be read from Vicon Nexus or directly from c3d
files.
